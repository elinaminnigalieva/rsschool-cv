        For the past 6 years, I've been working as a project manager.
        I've worked with various project and obtained a profession that I truly love. But recently I've started feeling lack of professional development. 
        Learning to code has been my long time wish and I thought now is a good time to try. So my goal right now is to obtain programming as a new skill and see where it takes me.
